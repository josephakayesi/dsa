### Stack

A **stack** is a linear data structure that follows the principle of **Last In, First Out (LIFO)**. This means elements can only be **added to** or **removed from** the top of the stack.

A common analogy is a **stack of plates** at a buffet or a **stack of Pringles**:

- You can only take the top plate (or chip) off.
- You can only place a new plate (or chip) on top.

The same principle applies in computer science.

### Core Operations in a Stack

- **`push`** – add an item to the top of the stack.
- **`pop`** – remove the item from the top of the stack.
- **`peek`** – view (but not remove) the item at the top of the stack.
- **`size()`** – return the number of elements currently in the stack.
- **`is_empty()`** – check whether the stack has no elements (often used internally but useful in practice).

### Real-World Use Cases of a Stack

- **Program execution** – function calls are managed using the call stack.
- **Browser history** – navigating back and forth relies on a stack to track visited pages.
- **Undo/Redo functionality** – text editors and IDEs use stacks to store recent actions.
- **Expression evaluation** – compilers and calculators use stacks to parse and evaluate mathematical expressions.
