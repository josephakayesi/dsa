# Data Structures & Algorithms Study Notes

This repository contains my personal studies on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).  
It serves as a learning log where I document detailed notes, problem-solving approaches, and reflections on what I’ve learned.

---

## What to Expect

- Detailed Notes: Clear explanations of concepts with examples.
- Code Implementations: Solutions in Python (and possibly other languages).
- Post-Mortems: Honest write-ups on problems I attempted — what went right, what went wrong, and what I learned.
- Topic Breakdowns: Each section focuses on a specific area of DSA, with theory and practice combined.

---

## Topics Covered (Work in Progress)

- Arrays & Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks & Queues
- Trees & Graphs
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Sorting & Searching
- Dynamic Programming
- System Design Basics (later on)

---

## Goals

- Strengthen my foundation in core DSA concepts.
- Improve problem-solving speed and clarity of thought.
- Build a personal reference I can revisit before interviews or projects.
- Reflect on mistakes through post-mortems to reinforce long-term learning.

---

## Study Style

- Each note will be accompanied by code samples.
- Problems solved will include:
  - Correct solution(s).
  - Failed/buggy attempts (with notes on why they failed).
- Post-mortems will highlight strategies, pitfalls, and insights.

## Progress Tracker

I’ll update this README as I progress through different topics and problem sets.  
Stay tuned for continuous learning and improvements.
