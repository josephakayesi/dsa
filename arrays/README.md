# Arrays

An **array** is a fundamental data structure that stores elements in **sequential memory locations**. Arrays maintain the order of elements and allow efficient access by index.

In the context of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**, arrays are often the basis for solving many problems. For example, strings can be thought of as arrays of charactersâ€”this insight makes it easier to reason about string manipulation problems.

## ðŸ“Œ Properties of Arrays

- **Contiguous memory allocation** â€“ items are stored sequentially without gaps.
- **Ordered elements** â€“ each element has a fixed position accessible by its index.
- **Fixed size at a low level** â€“ arrays typically have a fixed size, although higher-level constructs (like dynamic arrays) mimic variable size behavior.

## ðŸ”Ž Typed Arrays

In some languages (e.g., C, Java), arrays are **homogeneous**, meaning they can only store one type of data.  
In Python, arrays (implemented as lists) are more flexible and can hold elements of different types, though this comes at a performance cost.
